This repository contains multiple Python practice implementations covering Lambda Functions, List Comprehensions, and Database Connections. The goal of this project is to strengthen core Python concepts and understand how they are applied in real-world scenarios.

Lambda Functions

This section demonstrates the use of anonymous functions (lambda) in Python.
It includes:
Basic arithmetic operations
Conditional expressions using lambda
Using lambda with map()
Using lambda with filter()
Using lambda with reduce()
Sorting with sorted() and lambda
Functional-style programming examples
These examples help in understanding how lambda functions simplify small operations and improve code readability.

List Comprehensions

This section focuses on writing clean and efficient list comprehensions.

Database Connection

This section covers:
Connecting to a database using Python
Creating tables
Inserting validated user records
Implementing basic CRUD operations
